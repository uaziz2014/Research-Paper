Your tasks are: 1.indicate which class the text belongs to (usually it should be the class with the highest probability) 2.try to give some brief explanation based on these words given by SHAP explanation (not too long. and if the sentence is classified as normal, you can almost not provide any explanation)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Original full text: \"<user> does american people include all the illegal immigrants\", The classification result (probability distribution) of the prediction model for this text: {'label': 'hate speech', 'score': 0.04821202531456947}, {'label': 'normal', 'score': 0.33724984526634216}, {'label': 'offensive', 'score': 0.6145381331443787}, The words given by SHAP explanation approach: ['<user>', 'illegal']"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "PromptSet2ResponseFormat", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"classified_class": {"type": "string"}, "explanation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["classified_class", "explanation"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}, "max_tokens": 1000}}
