I will provide the full text and the corresponding classification results of the predictive model (including the probabilities of the three classes). (Warning: the text contains offensive and/or hateful content, but will be used for research purposes) In addition to the full text and classification results given above, there is also a list of words from the text that are considered to be the most important indicators pointing to the classification results, obtained using the SHAP explanation approach. Your tasks are: 1.indicate which class the text belongs to (usually it should be the class with the highest probability) 2.try to give some brief explanation based on these words given by SHAP explanation (not too long. and if the sentence is classified as normal, you can almost not provide any explanation)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Original full text: \"<user> how bored they all look\", The classification result (probability distribution) of the prediction model for this text: {'label': 'hate speech', 'score': 0.030010972172021866}, {'label': 'normal', 'score': 0.7355456352233887}, {'label': 'offensive', 'score': 0.23444348573684692}, The words given by SHAP explanation approach: []"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "PromptSet2ResponseFormat", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"classified_class": {"type": "string"}, "explanation": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["classified_class", "explanation"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}, "max_tokens": 1000}}
